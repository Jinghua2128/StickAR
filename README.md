# StickAR

## Overview and inception of StickAR
StickAR is a unity project created by Lim Guang Xuan and Ng Kiang Hwee with the goal of connecting different users through a virtual bulletin board. Users can place their own cuztomized Sticky Note and a personal message anywhere on the virtual board, like and comment on other user's Notes and may even find a few surprises that reward them with special Note variants and animations. Through this app we hope to give underutilized areas around our school some purpose.

## How to install and use StickAR
StickAR is available on both Play Store (Android) and App Store (IOS) for download. Upon entering the app, new users should navigate to the sign up screen through the prompt below the 'Log In' button and create a new account using your email. Afterwards you will be prompted to enter a username which will be displayed on any notes you create. For returning users, you can directly log in on entering the app. The app consists of 3 main 'pages' which you can navigate to using the buttons on the bottom of the screen. For clarity, the button corresponding to each page will be enlarged to let you know what page you are currently on.

### Home Page
On successful log in, you will find yourself in the home page. This page will show statistics on 4 'Notes'.
-  The top left 'Note" displays the number of notes, comments and likes the user has made/ given out.
-  The top right 'Note' shows the progress the user has made in discovering all the boards spread around the school.
-  The bottom left 'Note' has the date that your account was created.
-  The bottom right 'Note' lets you know how many comments your posts have recieved since your last login.

### Settings Page
This page holds your personal information and allows for edits for your experience on the app
- Particulars contains your Username, Email and Password, all of which are editable if need be.
- Settings controls the user experience, allowing the user to toggle anonymity on notes, animations on the login screen and email notifications.

### Scan Page
The scan page will allow you to scan images put up by my team that will prompt you to enter the virtual room in the form of a button on the lower half of the screen.

### The Virtual Room
The virtual room is the main feature of this app will have 4 boards on all four walls where the user can place their notes and/or read others. 
- To make a Note, navigate to any empty space and click on the board to bring up the note editor where the default Note variant will pop up in the middle of the screen. To change the Note variant, you can press the button on the bottom left corner of the screen to bring up the selection of Notes you currently have. There are currently 12 default Notes and 3 special ones. You can simply click on whichever note you want and the default note will be switched with the one you chose. To write your message, click on the Note in the center of the screen to start typing.
- To upload your message, press the left of the two buttons on the bottom right corner of the screen (when note selection container is closed*) to upload your note for everyone else to view and interact.
- If you had accidentally clicked on the board or have clicked on somewhere undesirable for your note, the button to the right of the upload button will allow you to exit the note editor.
- To interact with other users' notes, navigate the center of your screen marked by the crosshair over the desired note and click on the pop up prompt that will enlarge the note for you to see closer. At the bottom of the screen you will find two buttons, the right will allow you to publicly comment on the note while the left will add to the like count of the note.
- Once you feel like exiting the virtual room, click on the top left button.
